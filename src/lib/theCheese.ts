        type: `Gouda`,
        notes: `This absolute slammer was one of the few non-Carr cheeses I picked up at the Pike Place knockoff in Milwuakkee. This would be a great alternative to parmasan on pasta or pizza. If you're nutty for truffle like I am, you'll love this buttery gouda with an awesome truffle stank.`

    {
        name: 'Unexpected Cheddar',
        manufacturer: `Trader Joe's`,
        type: `Cheddar I didn't see coming`,
        notes: `I don't know if it's just cause I'm sitting in the river fucking slammed on boat snacks and mezcal but this cheese is fire, reasonably priced, and available at your local TJ's.`

        name: 'Reserve Gouda',
        manufacturer: 'Carr Valley',
        type: `Gouda`,
        notes: `Holy shit. I love this cheese. It's a Gouda with way more flavor than any I've had before and just the right amount of sharpness. This cheese bonks.`

        name: 'Applewood Smoked Cheddar',
        manufacturer: 'Carr Valley',
        type: `Cheddar`,
        notes: `Didn't have as much saltyness as I would like. Applewood smoke flavor was tasty.`

        name: 'Butterkase',
        manufacturer: 'Carr Valley',
        type: `Cow's milk`,
        notes: `It really tastes like butter. Probably in my top 10 for Carr Valley.`

        type: 'Bread Cheese',

        type: 'Cheddar',

        name: '12 Year Cheddar',
        manufacturer: 'Carr Valley',
        type: 'Cheddar',
        notes: `Probably not worth the price. It's kind of past the point of sharpness that is pleasant. Glad to have tried it, and would get a smaller brick of it in the future.`

        manufacturer: 'Carr Valley',
        type: 'Sheep Milk',

        manufacturer: 'Deer Creek',
        type: 'Cheddar',
