		<p>
			Since 2018, my friends and I have traveled from Colorado to Wisconsin to find the freshest
			cheese curds. What began as a simple search for the squeak has become a biennial tradition to
			find the best cheeses in Wisconsin. On our most recent trip in 2022 I realized that I
			completely forgot what cheeses I liked and didn't like from our previous visits. Part of that
			list is here.
